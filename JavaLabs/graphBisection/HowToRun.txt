Before you can compile and run my java implementations, you must install a J2SE full 
version on you PC, and put its bin directory on your PATH.

Assume you installed your version of J2SE in c:\j2se1.4. You can use Start|Run|cmd to 
launch a terminal window, and type 

    set PATH=c:\j2se1.4\bin;%PATH%

to set up your PATH. 

Download my file graphBisection.zip from URL 

    http://csis.pace.edu/~lixin/dps/

and unzip the file on your hard disk. Inside a terminal window, you change directory to 
the directory containing my Java source code.

To compile the source files, type 

    javac  GenData.java
    javac  PartGraph.java

To generate a new problem instance with 20 vertices into a file named graph20.txt, type

    java  GenData  20  graph20.txt

To run all heuristics on the same problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  PartGraph  graph20.txt

To run Exhaustive Search only on problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  ExhaustiveSearch  graph20.txt

To run Hill Climbing (local optimization) only on problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  HillClimbing  graph20.txt

To run Repeated Random only on problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  RepeatedRandom  graph20.txt

To run Simulated Annealing only on problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  SimulatedAnnealing graph20.txt

To run Tabu Search only on problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  TabuSearch  graph20.txt

To run Genetic Algorithm only on problem instance file graph20.txt, type

    java  GeneticAlgorithm  graph20.txt
